# 😊 Face Emotion Recognition

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a **Face Emotion Recognition System** using machine learning and computer vision techniques.
The model identifies human emotions (such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc.) from facial images captured through a camera or uploaded by the user.

The project includes:

* Data preprocessing and analysis
* Model building and training
* Real-time emotion detection
* A **Streamlit web application** for interactive emotion prediction

This project is developed as a **mini project** to gain hands-on experience in deep learning and computer vision.
